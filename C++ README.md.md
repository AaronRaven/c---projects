# Overview

I've created two C++ programs: one functions as a semi-scientific calculator, and the other reads text files to count words. While initially designed for LDS hymns, the latter program can handle any text file.
I've writen these programs as part of my journey to learn C++. The calculator incorporates a do-while loop and if statements to handle errors, employs cases for selecting mathematical functions, and integrates principles of functional programming. Meanwhile, the word counter utilizes file handling to open and process text files, uses while loop for word counting, and also implements if statements for error handling purposes.

# Development Environment

I utilized Visual Studio Code to write both of these programs.

The calculator program relies on the main iostream library for its core logic and incorporates the cmath library for mathematical calculations.Word counter uses fstream library to open and read files.

# Future Work

I'm considering ways to improve these programs. For the calculator, I'm thinking of integrating a user interface using a library such as Qt or SFML. I also want to enhance error handling to account for letters during option selection and mathematical operations.

Similarly, for the word counter, I'm planning to add a user interface and expand its capabilities to count individual words in the text for a more detailed analysis.
