# Overview

I've developed two C++ programs: one serves as a semi-scientific calculator, while the other is designed to count words in text files. Whole intended for LDS hymns, the word counter program can handle any text file format.
I've developed these programs as part of my journey to learn C++. The calculator utilizes a do-while loop and if statements to manage errors, features switch cases for selecting mathematical functions, and incorporates principles of functional programming. Meanwhike, the word counter employs file handling to open and process text files, emphasizing word counting. It also integrates if statements for error handling purposes.

# Development Environment

I utilized Visual Studio Code to write both of these programs.


The calculator program relies on the main <iostream> library for its core logic and incorporates the <cmath> library for mathematical calculations.Word counter uses <fstream> library to open and read files.

# Future Work

I'm considering ways to improve these programs. For the calculator, I'm thinking of integrating a user interface using a library such as Qt or SFML. I also want to enhance error handling to account for letters during option selection and mathematical operations.

Similarly, for the word counter, I'm planning to add a user interface and expand its capabilities to count individual words in the text for a more detailed analysis.
